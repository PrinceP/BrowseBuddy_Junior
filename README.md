3. System Requirements:
   - Minimum 22 GB free storage space
   - Maintain at least 10 GB free space after installation
   > Note: Different operating systems may report available space differently. On macOS, use Disk Utility for accurate measurements.

## Setup

### 1. Enable Gemini Nano and Prompt API

   - Navigate to `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model`
   - Set to "Enabled BypassPerfRequirement"

   - Set to "Enabled"

3. Relaunch Chrome

### 2. Verify Gemini Nano Installation

2. In the console, run:
   ```javascript

   ```javascript
   await ai.languageModel.create();
   ```
